Check the Issues tab above for what needs to be done.

Here's how we're going to do this:

You will clone this repository into a new intellij project (easy to do)

From there, you will choose your part of the project to work on.

You will do your work in your OWN branch of the repository so we don't overwrite each other's code.

When your code is done, you will commit and push the changes to the remote repository (Here)

You will then come to github and create a pull request from the branch you did your work in.

I/someone will review your code to make sure it does what it's supposed to do

I will write comments and suggested changes on your pull request to allow you to see what needs to be done if anything.

When your code is reviewed and approved, it will be merged with the main branch and your working branch will be deleted from the remote repository.

You will no longer need your working branch, as everything you do will be in a new branch.
